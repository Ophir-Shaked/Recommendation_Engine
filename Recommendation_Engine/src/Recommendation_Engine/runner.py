# - GENSIM_AVAILABLE: flag for gensim Word2Vec support.
# - SEEDS: list of random seeds for reproducibility.
# - HISTORY_PROFILES: user history lists for simulated recommendations.

# - ART_DIR: directory where experiment outputs (plots, logs, CSVs) are saved.
# - EXPORT_TOP_N: number of top recommendations exported per run.

    ----------
