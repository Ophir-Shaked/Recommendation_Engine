# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-  # File encoding declaration to safely handle Unicode text across platforms.
# Essential when filenames, strings, or outputs might contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., names, locales).

from __future__ import annotations
# Enables postponed evaluation of type hints — allows referencing classes before they're defined.

import os, csv, json, time, warnings
# Core Python utilities:
# - os: file paths, directory creation, environment variables.
# - csv/json: serialization for experiment outputs.
# - time: simple timing and timestamps for logs.
# - warnings: suppress or display controlled warnings cleanly.

from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple
# Standard typing aliases for static analyzers and editor intellisense — improves readability and safety.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
# NumPy for fast numeric array operations, pandas for tabular analytics and export to CSV summaries.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
# Converts text into TF-IDF features (term frequency–inverse document frequency).

from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
# Performs Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) via truncated SVD to reduce TF-IDF dimensionality.

from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer, StandardScaler
# Normalizer → L2 normalizes embedding vectors.
# StandardScaler → zero-mean/unit-variance scaling for dense features (e.g., numeric meta features).

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
# Used to measure similarity between article vectors and user profiles or between items (co-visitation).

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# Baseline linear classifier / reranker — used in base learners or meta layer.

from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV
# Wraps classifiers to output calibrated probabilities (Platt scaling or isotonic).

from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
# K-fold cross-validation preserving class ratios — ensures balanced splits for click/non-click data.

from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier
# Two main ensemble models:
# - HGB: gradient-boosted trees with efficient histogram bins (fast, low-RAM).
# - ExtraTrees: randomized trees ensemble providing diversity and decorrelation.

from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
# Linear Support Vector Classifier for optional linear-margin modeling; may be calibrated later.

from .env_and_imports import *  # uses many constants as free names
# Pulls configuration constants (e.g., PRESET, ART_DIR, SEEDS, thresholds) into local scope.
# Wildcard import is acceptable here since this file depends on nearly all shared constants.

from .embedders import GlobalEmbedder, W2VEmbedder
# Import embedding classes:
# - GlobalEmbedder: TF-IDF + optional LSA pipeline for global corpus vectors.
# - W2VEmbedder: wrapper around gensim Word2Vec or pseudo2vec fallback.

from .plots_and_metrics import (_sigmoid, recency_decay, plot_roc_single, plot_pr_curve, plot_confusion_matrix_heatmap)
# Imports reusable math and visualization helpers:
# - _sigmoid: logistic transform for logits → probabilities.
# - recency_decay: exponential time weighting for freshness features.
# - plot_roc_single / plot_pr_curve: ROC and PR visualizations with AUCs.
# - plot_confusion_matrix_heatmap: 2×2 confusion plot with normalization support.

from .export_utils import _write_top_k_for_recipient
# Helper function to export ranked recommendations in both TXT (human-readable) and CSV (structured) form.

from .synthetic_corpus import Article
# Data container (dataclass) representing synthetic article objects (id, title, body, category, timestamp).

# (For brevity, the full training pipeline is omitted in this scaffold.)
# This file sets up imports and shared context for the training pipeline — it’s a scaffold or module hub.
# In your full system, this would include functions such as:
#   - build_big_corpus(seed)
#   - train_base_models()
#   - evaluate_val_test()
#   - aggregate_results()
# Keep notebook logic here in reproducible, script-ready form (protocol preserved).
# Add your train/validation/test logic here as in your notebook version.
# Place run_once() / run_many() implementations or equivalent pipeline driver functions here.
